100 Days of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Projects

Welcome to the 100 Days of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Projects folder! My name is Pranjal, and I created this repository to document and share the journey of creating one project every day for 100 days. Each project is designed to strengthen foundational skills in front-end web development while exploring creative and practical implementations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What's Inside

This folder contains:

100 unique projects: Each project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing various techniques, concepts, and real-world applications.

Code files: All source files for every project are well-organized into subfolders, making it easy to navigate and explore.

A series playlist: To complement these projects, a dedicated playlist is available, featuring tutorials, explanations, and walkthroughs for each project. The playlist acts as a guide to help others follow along or gain insights into the development process.

How to Use

Explore the Projects:

Navigate to the subfolders to view individual project files.

Each folder includes an index.html file to launch the project in a browser.

Accompanying README.md files (if available) provide additional details about specific projects.

Follow the Series Playlist:

Access the video tutorials for step-by-step guidance.

The playlist is structured to align with the projects in this repository.

Learn and Experiment:

Use these projects as a learning resource to enhance your front-end development skills.

Experiment with the code to customize and expand upon the ideas.

Acknowledgments

This journey was inspired by the "100 Days of Code" challenge, aiming to foster consistency and growth in programming skills. Thank you for checking out this repository. I hope it serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in web development.

Feel free to reach out for feedback, suggestions, or collaboration ideas. Happy coding!
